Dear Diary,

Today I had a breakfast burrito. It was awesome.


Drew didn't have a breakfast burrito. I don't know why. But he did recommend a barber to me and that worked out well.

I solemly swear that I am up to no good.
I solemly swear that I am up to no good.
I solemly swear that I am up to no good.
I solemly swear that I am up to no good.
I solemly swear that I am up to no good.
I solemly swear that I am up to no good.

XOXO,

Abhi
